## Count Bits

Implement a function that, given an integer n, uses a specific method on it and returns the number of bits in its binary representation.

*Note: in this task and most of the following tasks you will be given a code snippet with some part of it replaced by the ellipsis (...). Only this part is allowed to be changed.*

#### Example

For n = 50, the output should be
countBits(n) = 6.

5010 = 1100102, a number that consists of 6 digits. Thus, the output should be 6.

#### Input/Output

* **[input] integer n**

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 109.

* **[output] integer**

The number of bits in binary representation of n.
